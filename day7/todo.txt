// parse data

// order by weakest to strongest hand
    // Check for type first. Higher types always win
        // Put each type in its own array. And then go through those arrays to determine weakest hands among them
    // Then arrange each type array based on strength - check if itâ€™s the same type, based on the individual cards
    // Then combine these arrays back to a big array - weakest to strongest. Using (index + 1) as the rank number

// get answer
    // iterate through all hands
    // answer *= rank
    // answer += bid
